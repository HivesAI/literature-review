    "The ***Pollen API***  lets you request pollen data for a specific location. Pollen data includes regional plant species and pollen types, as well as pollen index and health recommendations. The Pollen API covers over 65 countries with a resolution of 1 x 1 kilometer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API provides endpoints that let you query:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Forecast: Up to 5-day pollen forecast with daily information, including pollen index for types of plants.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Heatmaps: Color-coded tiles of 3 pollen types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interesting feature of this API\n",
    "- The Pollen API continuously calculates the **value** of various **pollen types** and plant indices with **1 x 1 kilometer resolution**\n",
    "- **Health recommendations**, implemented at the plant type level according to the pollen index levell\n",
    "- **Plant description details**, information that relate to the plant and **its potential for allergenic effect**. The description includes the following information: type, family, season, special shapes, special colors, cross reaction, and 2 pictures of each plant.\n",
    "- **Heatmaps of pollen type index**, that can be displayed on Google Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pollen API supported plants\n",
    "In Italy the plant types available are **trees, grass and weeds**. In particular, the supported plants are hazel, alder, ash, birch, cottonwood, oak, olive, pine, grasses, ragweed, mugwort.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Origin of the data\n",
    "As mentioned on google: \"Our Pollen API is based on a model that calculates the seasonality and daily amount of pollen grains on a 1x1 km2 grid in over 65 countries worldwide, supporting an up to 5-day forecast, 3 plant types, and 15 different plant species. The model uses various inputs like land cover, climatological data, annual pollen production per plant, and more to deliver reliable output predictions of the local pollen level and exposure risk.\"\n",
